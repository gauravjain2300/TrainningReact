Routing
Routing: in simple language we can say navigation between one component another 
component
but as we know that react js is for SPA

it just replace component instead of navigate
 to manage routing in react js there is one library its called React-Router-Dom
before use routing we have to add this dependency in project.
#npm i react-router-dom



useNavigate(): useNavigate() is one of the most 
                popular hook which is used to create dynamic navigation in single page application

                Which is provide by react-router-dom.

                in simple programatically we can control navigation between components..


navigate(-1): Backward one step Back
navigate(1): Forward one step next
